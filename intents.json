            "as per your history due to your eating disorders and resultant protein deficiency your musculoskeletal system might be weak. this might be the cause of your tiredness associated with workouts. so to manage the situation it will be essential that you consult with a fitness trainer or a physiotherapist who can examine you and provide tips and advice about regaining your fitness. other possible issues like obesity arthritis myopathies etc also might need to be ruled out by proper consultation with your doctor. i hope this helps."

            "radioactive iodine (rai) is often chosen for treatment of conditions associated with overactive thyroid including hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancers. rai treatment is based on the fact that the thyroid actively accumulates iodine which it uses to produce thyroid hormones required for normal body function. the therapeutic action of rai is via disruption of the function of the thyroid cells - the more radioactive iodine given the more cells cease to function. as the cells stop functioning excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are no longer produced and symptoms of hyperthyroidism begin to disappear. in your case the side effects of such therapy will be limited to short term effects like sore throat nausea fatigue etc. there will be no effect on other organs like kidneys nor any effect on the sexual desire and sexual function. but once the treatment is completed you will need lifelong therapy with thyroxine supplements to prevent hypothyroidism related symptoms."

            "one time episode of hypoglycemia? this was an extremely concerning experience: on a no-carb diet for 1. 5 weeks and had a day where i was really busy and feeling a little out of sorts. only ate a small meal of chicken and spinach around 11 a. m. as the day progressed i continued to feel out of sorts shaky and a bit confused but was trying to get things done and did not eat. in the early evening i had a few glasses of wine with friends and reacted very badly becoming confused and feeling more intoxicated than usual. my behavior was not reflective of my usual behavior. i am wondering if i became hypoglycemic due to diet lack of food and then when i drank alcohol became more hypoglycemic. i am otherwise healthy and have never experienced this previously or after. the only difference was diet and not eating enough for a long period of time. having some wine is not unusual but the reaction was as was my behavior/mood/feelings throughout the day"

            "hi skipping meals is causing hypoglycemia to your body. if you took wine while fasting (without eating anything); then alcohol in wine has lowered your blood sugar more leading to sever hypoglycemia. i'd suggest to: - have your meals regularly; do not skip any - eat often and small portions - do chew up slowly do not rush - avoid high calorie foods - avoid alcohol and smoking especially while you do not eat anything - avoid caffeine or other stimulants all the best! feel free to ask me again if you have further questions! dr. alba"
